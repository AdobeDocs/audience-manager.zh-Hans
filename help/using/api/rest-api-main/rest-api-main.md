# REST API {#rest-apis}

[!UICONTROL RESTful APIs] 使用Audience Manager以编程方式工作。

The Audience Manager [!DNL REST API] follows [!DNL JavaScript Object Notation] ( [JSON](https://www.json.org/)) standards for formatting sent and received data. A principal advantage of [!DNL JSON] is that it helps make [!DNL API] queries easy to write, read, and parse by developers and machines.

To simplify your work even more, we are migrating our REST APIs to [Swagger](https://swagger.io/solutions/api-documentation/). For more information, see [Audience Manager API Code Migration](/help/using/api/api-swagger-migration.md).

Review the [Getting Started](../../api/rest-api-main/aam-api-getting-started.md#getting-started-with-rest-apis) material before working with the Audience Manager [!DNL API] methods.
